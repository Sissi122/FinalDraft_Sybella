     Sina Gerard, a young and ambitious Rwandan, founded URWIBUTSO Enterprise in 1983 with a single employee. URWIBUTSO is a memorable phrase. It all began with a little shop in Ruhengeri or contemporary Musanze, and the bakery began operations in 1985 at Nyirangarama. Initially, SINA Gerard provided free beef stews and bread to tourists and truckers in order for them to sample his products. Later, in 1993, after ten years of business experience, SINA Gerard officially established his company under the name URWIBUTSO, which is delivered by individuals who have tried his beignets or amandazi.Today, the local food processing firm employs 421 people and has contracts with 3,000 farmers, making it one of Rwanda's largest businesses in its field. It is geared toward the agro-processing business. The firm is located in Nyirangarama, Rulindo District, Northern Province, approximately 45 kilometers from Kigali City, on the Kigali Musanze - Rubavu major route.
